ArrayList

1. default size is 10 elements
2. arr.add() method adds to the end of the array.
3. arr.add(1,"C") adds the element "C" at index 1.
NOTE: if a element is inserted at a location which is > size of arraylist then index out of bound exception is thrown
                   ___arr.add() -> O(1)
Time complexity -|
                   ---arr.add(1,"C") -> O(n)

Space Complexity -> Amortized O(1) : time to resize an array will also be fixed.

Access Arraylist

arr.get(index)
Time Complexity O(1)
Space Complexity O(1)

Traversal
Time Complexity O(n)
Space Complexity O(1)

Searching
Time Complexity for searching an element is O(n)
Time complexity for accessing using index is O(1)
Space Complexity O(1)

Deleting

arr.remove(index)
element is removed at that index, then all other elements to the right are shifted to left.
Thus the last element of the arraylist gets empty.
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity O(1)
