**Hashing**

  - Hash Functions
    - Mod - input is number
      - mod(400,24) => 16
    - ASCII - input is string
      - modASCII("ABC",24) => (65+66+67) mod 24 => 6
  - Properties of Hash Functions
    - Distributes the hash values uniformly across hash tables
    - It has to use all input data
  - Collision Resolution Technique
    - Direct Chaining
      - It has an array of references. it stores the reference of a link-list
      - 
    - Open Addressing : Colliding elements are stored in other vacant buckets. These buckets are found by 'probing'
      - Liner Probing
        - It places the key into closest following empty cell.
      - Quadratic probing
      - Double hashing
  - Hash Table is Full
    - Direct Chaining
      - hashtable is never full as we keep on adding node.
    - Open Addressing
      -  Create 2X size of current hashTable and recall hashing for current keys
      - based on load factor, if it is greater than 0.75 then a new hashtable is created and items are moved to it.
