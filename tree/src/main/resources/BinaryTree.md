**Binary Tree**

- Full Binary Tree
  - A node will always have 2 child or 0 child.
- Perfect Binary Tree
  - a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children
            and all leaves have the same depth or same level
- Complete Binary Tree
  - a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last,
            is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far
            left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes at the last level h.
            A perfect tree is therefore always complete but a complete tree is not always perfect.
- Balanced Binary Tree
  - All Leaf nodes are located at same distance from root node.
  - OR
    - difference between the left and the right subtree for any node is not more than one
    - the left subtree is balanced
    - the right subtree is balanced
- Implementation
  - linked List (Doubly LL)
    - Doubly LL
    - left pointer point to left child
    - right pointer points to right child
  - Array
    - Start saving Data from index 1
    - Left Child  = cell[2x]
    - Right child = cell[2x+1]

    - Insert
      - LinkList impl
          - A root Node is null
          - Tree exist-> look for first empty space.
          - Do a **level order traversal** and then insert the element at vacant place.
      - Array List Impl
        - check if arr is full or not
        - insert data at lastused+1 index & increment lastIndexUsed by 1
    - Delete a node
      - Find a Node
      - Find the deepest node
      - Set the deepest Node value to the current Node
      - delete the deepest node
    - Delete Tree
      - Root=null;
