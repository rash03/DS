Tree
    - 2 Components
        - Data
        - Link to sub categoryÂ©
        - base Category and Sub Category under it
     - Store Hierarchical Data, like Folder structure, organisation Structure etc
     - Tree Data Structure
        - Binary Tree
        - Binary Search
            - performs fast search, insert on sorted data
            - type of Binary Tree
        - AVL Tree
            - type of Binary Tree
        - Red Black Tree
            - type of Binary Tree
        - Trie
        - B Tree
        - B+ Tree
        - Splay Tree
        - Segment Tree
        - Fenwick Tree (Binary Index Tree)
        - Quad Tree
        - Oct Tree
     - Terminology
        - Root - Node which does not have parent
        - Edge - Link between two nodes
        - Leaf - Node which does not have any children
        - Sibling - Children Node of same Parent
        - Ancestor - Parent and grandparent of a node
        - Depth of Node - length of path from root to node
        - Height of Node - length of the path from the node to the deepest node
        - depth of Tree - Depth of root Node = 0
        - Height of tree - height of root node
