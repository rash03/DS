**Binary Heap**
  - It is a Binary Tree with some additional properties
  - A node can have only 2 Node
  - A binary Heap is either MIN Heap or MAX Heap
    - Min Binary Heap - The root must be the minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap.
    - Max Binary Heap - The root must be the maximum among all keys present in Binary Heap.
  - It is a complete Tree 
    - All level are completely filled except possibly the last level.
    - Last level has all keys as left as possible
      - This property makes them suitable to be stored in an array.
  - Why we need binary Tree
    - When we want minimum or maximum number among a set of numbers in O(LogN) time. Also we want that insertion of 
    numbers does not take more than O(logN) time.
      - Possible Solutions
        - Store Numbers in sorted array => search-minimum is O(1) but insertion is O(N) - X
        - Store number in LinkList => insertion is O(N) - X
        - Store number in Binary Heap => Guarantees both insertion and find minimum takes O(logN) time - √√
