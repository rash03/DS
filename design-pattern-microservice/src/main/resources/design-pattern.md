**Pattern for Microservice**
- APi Gateway Pattern
  - Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests from clients to the appropriate microservices.
- Aggregator Pattern
  - Used to aggregate responses from multiple microservices into a single response
- Proxy Pattern
  - Similar to the API Gateway, but usually implemented as a lightweight proxy.
- Database per service Pattern
  - Each microservice has its own database to ensure loose coupling and autonomy.
- Event Sourcing Pattern
  - Instead of storing the current state of the data, all changes to the application state are stored as a sequence of events
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern
  - Separates the read and write operations on a data model into two distinct models.
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
  - Prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services.
- Saga Pattern
  - Manages distributed transactions across multiple microservices, ensuring consistency and rollback capabilities.
- Service Discovery Pattern
  - Allows services to discover each other dynamically at runtime, often using a registry.
- Strangler Pattern
  - Gradually replaces parts of a legacy system with new microservices
- Bulkhead Pattern
  - Isolates different parts of the system to prevent a failure in one service from affecting others.
- Sidecar Pattern
  - Deploys auxiliary components or services alongside the main service to manage cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring, and security
- Health Check Pattern
  - Regularly checks the health and status of microservices to ensure they are functioning correctly.
- Retry Pattern
  - Automatically retries failed requests to handle transient failures
- Distributed Tracing Pattern
  - Tracks requests as they flow through the system to debug and monitor performance
