stack example : Browser's back button.

Create Stack
    - Array
        - need to declare size : Fixed Size
        - easy impl
        - Space Complexity : O(N)
    - linkList
        - No need to declare size : variable Size
        - Need to do more operations using linklist  : cOmplex impl
        - Add an element in stack means adding a element at the beginning of link list.
        - POP means remove element from beginning of link list
        - pEek means reading the head element
        - isempty => head==null
        - delete => head = null

    - advantage
          - LIFO functionality
          - chance of data corruption is less
    - disadvantage
          - random access is not possible.
