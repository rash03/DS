1.Elements of LinkList are independent Objects,
Array consists of contiguous memory location,
 so the elements of array are not independent object

2. Array are of fixed length whereas Linked list are of variable length

3. Random access in case of Array is efficient as compared to link list
IN case of link list we have to iterate from head to the desired location to get
the value

Type of Link List
ø Singly LinkList
ø Circular Singly LinkList
ø Doubly LinkList
ø Circular Doubly LinkList

Circular => Lastnode contains the location of first Node ( which is not the
head node). head node contains location of firstNode. Tail node contains
location of last node.
Ewxample=> game of cards => with 4 player the chance of playing loops from
player 1 then 2 then3 then 4 and again 1
It is possible to go
from 1st to last and last to 1st
In Singly Linklist last node contains null as next location pointer

Doubly => a node contains reference of previous and next node
Example = > Music Playlist => next song or previous song =>
Each node contains its previous and next => we can iterate back and forward from any node
